# Where are all the item thumbnails?

The item thumbnails are not currently stored in the Git repository, as they total ~90MB with everything I've extracted. I think in the future I would like to make creating these item shop screenshots entirely configured on the website itself, which would also include uploading these thumbnails to the cloud. Until then, they aren't currently publicly accessible.
