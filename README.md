# RLSS Item Shop

This project is what we use to generate item shop images like above. Offerings can be added to the array in `./src/offerings.ts` using our items package `@rlss/items` to then display them on `localhost:3000`. From here, take a screenshot of a webpage set to **2048x1024** to ensure the content fits the page correctly, and share!

A web version of this is in progress where the items can be set on the page itself rather than through code, though it is a low priority so it isn't being actively developed. We also would like to eventually display it directly on the [rlss.gg](https://rlss.gg) website.
